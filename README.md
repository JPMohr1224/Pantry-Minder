This Pantry Minder project was developed to assist in pantry and kitchen inventory and organizing. 
I frequently finding myself shopping and buying products only to return home and realize that I already posses multiple.
The project uses a MySql Database, ASP.Net MVC and Dapper.
This website in its first stage will allow all CRUD functions.
The user has the ability to add to the pantry items database, view listings, update names, quantities and sizes and also delete products.
The user can also search by the name of the pantry item or the catagory of the item.
Future plans for this project include developing its responsiveness to device interface, adding a "Shopping List" feature.
